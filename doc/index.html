    <h1>libebb</h1>

    <p>
    libebb is a lightweight HTTP server library for C.  It abstracts the
    socket handling and request parsing. It handles persistant connections,
    pipelined requests, chunked uploads, or any other HTTP/1.1 complient
    junk you might throw at it.  
    </p>
    <ul>
    <li>there are no allocations made</li>
    <li>the <a
      href="http://software.schmorp.de/pkg/libev.html">libev</a> event loop
    is used.
    </li>
    <li>it is single threaded
    </li>
    <li>the parser is nearly optimally fast.
      it is a state machine written in <a
      href="http://research.cs.queensu.ca/~thurston/ragel/">Ragel</a>
    </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
    libebb does not support SSL, but may in the future.
    </p>
    <p>
    libebb is intended to be used as the central engine in
    all types of web servers: load balancers (like perlbal), embeded
    servers (like Mongrel), or even full service servers like Nginx.
    </p>
